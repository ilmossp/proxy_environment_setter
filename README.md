# proxy_environment_setter
simple bash script that sets environment variables to fix proxy settings not working with sudo in the command line.
In order for this to work on the initial run, make sure u remove any proxy related setting in environment and remove any files with the names environment.bak and envronment.proxy.bak.
I hope this works for you !!! ğŸ˜ƒ ğŸ˜ƒ ğŸ˜ƒ ğŸ˜ƒ
